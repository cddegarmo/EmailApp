# emailapp
##### About
This project originated in a YouTube tutorial on implementing some basic OOP concepts in Java. My augmented version involves the two Java files
*EmailAccount* and *EmailApp*, with the latter containing the main method. The program has been expanded to mimic a company intranet application that 
tracks employees and their salaries; it can be run from *Register*.

### Upcoming
Future versions will involve communication with a database to store and retrieve employee information (it currently reads employees from a csv file), and
a more friendly user interface.
